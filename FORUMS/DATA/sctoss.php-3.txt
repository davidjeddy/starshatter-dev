message:   well, honestly I have not been able to work on it much latly. I just got a job so its taken a little bit more time than I would like but thats almost over.[n]   I gatta make the weapons and tweeak the DEF file. The fighter launching will have to wait until after the next patch 'cause we cann't have angles launch decks yet.[n]   Can you get me some in game Sc pics of the BC firing it's weapons? Just so I have something to go off when I make the weapons. Heck if you can decompile SC and keep it though would be good.[n]L8er yo<br><br>Ipicked up a Magic 8 ball and it said "Outlook not so good." I said "Yea, I know, but Microsoft ships it anyways."
