message:Hey!!![n][n]I am wondering if I have the most current demo. I think mine is 35 - does that make sense?[n][n]I am so impressed that you have B5 mods available. How I wish I had the know-how to provide you with some help with those projects. I have lots of ideas, but with no formal training I have no idea how to turn idea into finished product.[n][n]Anyway - you folks continue to make incredible strides. Everyone ought to be very proud of the stuff you have accomplished.[n][n]I won't take up more space...<br><br><span class='forumedit'>Message Edited by cybersleuth58 as of 06.13.03 09:42 PM</span>[n][n]
